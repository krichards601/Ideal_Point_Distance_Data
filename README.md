# Ideal Point Distances and Bloc Classifications
Here you will our datasets containing various Ideal Point Estimates and bloc classifications along with documentation on variable definition and IPD generation process. 
Due to size constraints, we had to split our IPD dataset by year, though the process of reconstrucrting the full panel is straightforward. 
See "IPD Information and Variable Definitions.docx" for more information on each dataset.
